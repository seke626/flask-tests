# flask-tests
A suite of tests in relation to Python's Flask to demonstrate my understanding of Flask's testing framework

1. Route Test: This test checks if the home route of the Flask application returns a successful response (status code 200).

2. Template Test: This test checks if the home route of the Flask application renders the correct template and contains the expected content.

3. Form Test: This test checks if the login form of the Flask application accepts valid input and logs the user in successfully.

4. Database Test: This test checks if the User model in the Flask application can be instantiated with the correct attributes.

5. API Test: This test checks if the API endpoint for retrieving user information returns the expected data in JSON format.
